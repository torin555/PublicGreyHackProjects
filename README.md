--Discription
  A place for me to share my GreyScript.

--metaXploitFrameWork / Public Build : 
  Made a fun Exploit creator that i enjoyed useing. Unlike other tools it as no overflow in the active script. Everything is generated with the finest exploits and the largest adjective list ever created (by me). Nothing may be documented in script help please play around. OH anything set as a number is a bool ether 0 or 1. 
  type 'help' for basics. 'use' a module. --> 'help' in module

.note
  localexploitation was just slapped in there so a better idea is needed altho the script works.
  I understand the script isent very helpfull for learning nor can you imagin me comfortable working with it, i got by and loved it.
