--Discription
  A place for me to share my GreyScript.

--metaXploitFrameWork / Public Build
  Made a fun Exploit creator that i enjoyed useing. Unlike other tools it as no overflow in the active script. Everything is generated with the finest exploits and the largest adjective list ever created (by me).

.note
  localexploitation was just slapped in there so a better idea is needed altho the script works
